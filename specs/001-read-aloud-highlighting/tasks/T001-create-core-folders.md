# T001 Create core folders per plan

**Phase**: Setup
**Depends on**: None

## Task

Create the core project folders listed in the plan so the rest of the work has known targets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Folders exist: `app/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `data/`, `styles/`
- No extra placeholder files are required in these folders

## Instructions

1. Create the folders at the repo root if they do not exist.
2. Do not add files yet unless required by tooling.
