./app/library/LibraryContent.tsx
42:11  Warning: The 'effectiveProfiles' conditional could make the dependencies of useMemo Hook (at line 48) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'effectiveProfiles' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
307:8  Warning: React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'currentUserId'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
362:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'loadBooks'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/my-words/components/WordInspectModal.tsx
155:29  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./app/my-words/components/WordListItemCompact.tsx
118:29  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./components/auth/auth-provider.tsx
184:6  Warning: React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'supabase.auth'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
247:6  Warning: React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'logout'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/landing-page/demos/ReaderDemo.tsx
109:8  Warning: React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'lastWordIndex'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/reader/library-view.tsx
129:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'onSearchChange'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. If 'onSearchChange' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/story-maker/StoryMakerClient.tsx
369:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
