    "text": "In the rainforest, next to a wide river, there grew a great banyan tree. \nThis tree was ancient and provided a home for the many animals living in the area.\n\nHenrietta Heron had a beautiful nest high atop the Banyan tree. Carl Crayfish lived in tangled roots that entered the river at the waters edge. Sam the Black Snake had made his home under the great trunk of the tree. Marty Mongoose lived nearby. His home wasn’t actually in the Banyan tree but close enough where the tree offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon.\n\nHis home wasn’t actually in the banyan tree but close enough. The tree \noffered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon. Now you must realize that not all animals in the rainforest are friends. They depend on one another for different things, many times for food.\n\nTo better understand this let me explain how Henrietta, Carl, Sam, and Marty live within the great Banyan tree.\n\nHenrietta Heron had built her nest by the river so she that would be close \nto the food she usually ate. Her diet consisted of fish, frogs, crayfish, and even snails. She had a great home.\n\nNow Carl Crayfish lived within the rocks and roots of the tree. Carl was really a scavenger. He would eat the pieces of food dropped by other animals and his home offered protection from animals that might snack on him.\n\nSam the Black Snake made his home under the great Banyan tree as it was close to many things he liked to eat. Sam preferred bird eggs but didn’t hesitate to eat anything he could catch, except maybe whole crayfish as they were very hard to swallow.\n\nCan you guess what Marty Mongoose liked to eat? Well if you said snakes, then you are absolutely correct. Marty liked to eat snakes of all types and sizes.\n\nOne day, Henrietta was out looking for food. When she returned to her nest, she found that two of her eggs were gone. Oh, how sad she was! Something had gotten into her nest and eaten two of her precious eggs.\n\nShe flew back down to the river so no other birds would see her crying. Then she saw Marty and said to him, “Sam must have slithered into my nest and eaten two of my eggs.” “That is a shame,” Marty replied in a sad voice. “Oh, what can I do?” Henrietta asked.\n\nNow Marty knew that Henrietta, and the other herons, liked to eat crayfish \nand, if there were an easy meal to be had, he was very interested. “So, you would like to get rid of that bothersome snake?” he asked Henrietta. “Oh, yes!” Henrietta sighed. “I wish something would eat him.”\n\n“Henrietta, I can help you,” Marty said excitedly. “You and your heron friends need to catch all the fish and crayfish in the area. Break them into pieces and leave a trail of food from Sam’s den to my home. He will be busy eating the food and he will not realize that he is close to me. He will be an easy meal for me and you will be rid of his egg stealing ways.”\n\nHenrietta thought for a minute, smiled, and then flew off to talk with the other herons. Soon the herons had captured all the fish, crayfish (even poor Carl) and made the trail of food between the snake’s den and the home of the mongoose. Then they returned to their nests to watch.\n\nAs Sam slithered out of his den, he was surprised to see all the fresh snacks just lying on the ground. “Yummy! Yummy!” he thought to himself as he began eating.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Sam had eaten his way to Marty’s home. As Sam opened his mouth to eat the last snack, Marty jumped out of from \nthe bushes. Well, I don’t have to tell you what happened because you \nalready know. But in case you don’t, there was a big B-U-R-P and \nMarty returned home.\n\n“Did you see that?” Henrietta asked the other herons. “Now our eggs are safe.”\n\nThe other herons saw Marty climbing the tree but it was too late \nto warn Henrietta. All they could do was leave their nests and, like the snakes, find a safer home.\n\nNow Marty was alone. There was no food in the area, and no reason for him to stay in his nice home, protected by the great banyan tree.\n\nThe great banyan tree is now empty of all life. But there is a circle-of-life in the rainforest and it won’t be long before new animals arrive at the banyan tree, and call it “home”.\n\nPlease share our books with your friends and family to support our mission.
