    "text": "Sunny the fox woke up early and stretched his paws. He saw a pink sky, a sleepy moon, and tall trees swaying in a gentle breeze. Sunny tiptoed to the creek where the water glittered like tiny stars. He met Lila the bunny, who carried a basket of blueberries. They counted the berries, then shared a laugh when a silly squirrel dropped an acorn on his own head. Sunny and Lila decided to explore the path of crunchy leaves. They found a smooth rock shaped like a heart and placed it beside the trail as a sign for other friends. Next they met Max the bear, who was making a honey sandwich with a warm smile. Max offered a bite and asked if they wanted to build a cloud picture. The three friends lay on the grass and named shapes in the sky. A big cloud looked like a boat, and a tiny cloud looked like a fish. Soon the sun climbed higher and warmed their fur. They walked toward the meadow and saw Mia the bird practicing a new song. Sunny clapped, Lila twirled, and Max hummed along. Together they made a friendly choir. When the day grew quiet, they promised to meet again by the creek and tell new stories."
