The rain fell hard on Gotham City. The streets were dark and wet. Batman stood on a tall building. His cape moved in the wind. He looked down at the city below. Batman was ready to keep everyone safe.

Batman heard a loud alarm. It came from the big museum. He jumped from the building. His cape spread wide like wings. He swung through the rainy streets. The museum had a problem. Batman had to help.

Inside the museum, Batman looked around. Footprints were on the floor. A window was broken. The special diamond was gone. Batman found clues everywhere. He would solve this mystery.

Batman followed the footprints outside. They led to an old warehouse. He opened the door slowly. Inside, he found the stolen diamond. The thief was caught. Batman returned the diamond to the museum.

The rain stopped falling. The city was safe again. People smiled and waved at Batman. He stood on a rooftop watching over Gotham. His work was done for tonight. Batman would always protect his city.
