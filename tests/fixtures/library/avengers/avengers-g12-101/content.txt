The Avengers stood in front of a big pile of rocks. Iron Man tried to blast them away. Captain America pushed with his shield. Thor used his hammer to hit the rocks. But nothing worked! The rocks were too heavy and too big. Black Widow looked worried. The team needed help right away.

Bruce Banner stepped forward to help his friends. He had black messy hair and wore purple pants. Bruce knew what he had to do. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. His heart began to beat faster and faster. Bruce started to feel very strong inside. It was time to transform!

Bruce's body began to change and grow! His skin turned bright green all over. His muscles got bigger and bigger. His shirt ripped and tore apart! Now he was the mighty Hulk. The Hulk was very tall and very strong. He roared loudly at the pile of rocks.

The Hulk walked up to the heavy rocks. He bent down and grabbed the biggest boulder. The Hulk lifted it high above his head! He threw it far away into an empty field. Then he picked up another rock and another. The other Avengers cheered for their strong friend. Hulk moved all the rocks away from the path.

The path was clear at last! The Avengers could continue their mission now. Iron Man patted Hulk on his big green arm. Captain America smiled and said thank you. The Hulk was happy to help his team. Together, the Avengers were stronger than ever. They were the mightiest superhero team in the world!
