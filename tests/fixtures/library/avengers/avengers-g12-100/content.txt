Tony Stark stood in his big workshop. Shiny tools covered the tables. He had a great idea for something new. Tony wanted to build a special suit. The suit would be red and gold. It would help him fly high in the sky.

Tony worked day and night on his suit. He used his silver tools to build each part. The chest piece began to glow bright. It looked like a small sun. Tony put on the red helmet. Now the suit was ready to test.

Tony walked outside to the open field. The sun was shining bright above. He felt nervous but excited too. Tony pressed a button on his suit. The boots started to hum loudly. Suddenly, he lifted off the ground.

Tony flew higher and higher up. He zoomed past the tall buildings. The city looked so small below him. Cars looked like tiny toys on streets. People pointed up at the sky. Tony felt like a real superhero now.

Tony landed back at his workshop safely. He was so happy and proud. His suit worked perfectly in the sky. Now he could help people everywhere. Tony knew he would join other heroes. Together they would be the mighty Avengers team.
