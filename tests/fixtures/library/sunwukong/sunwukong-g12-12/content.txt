Sun Wukong the Monkey King walked through the underwater palace of the Dragon King. The palace was made of shining coral and glowing pearls. Sun Wukong needed a weapon to fight bad guys. The Dragon King showed him many swords and spears. But Sun Wukong was very strong. Every weapon he touched broke into pieces. "I need something better," said Sun Wukong with a big grin.

The Dragon King pointed to a dark corner of his treasure room. There stood a huge iron pillar covered in seaweed. It glowed with a red and gold light. "That is the Ruyi Jingu Bang," said the Dragon King. "It was used by the gods to measure the sea long ago. It weighs as much as the whole ocean. Nobody can lift it." Sun Wukong's eyes sparkled with excitement. He walked toward the magical pillar.

Sun Wukong grabbed the giant pillar with both hands. His muscles grew tight and strong. He pulled with all his might. The pillar began to shake and glow brighter. Then, slowly, it lifted off the ground! The Dragon King gasped in surprise. The water in the palace swirled and bubbled. Sun Wukong laughed with joy. "This is perfect for me!" he shouted.

The magical staff began to change in Sun Wukong's hands. "Smaller!" he said, and the huge pillar shrank down to the size of a walking stick. The staff became light and easy to hold. Golden words appeared on it that said it could grow or shrink as he wished. Sun Wukong spun the staff around and around. It made a whooshing sound through the water. "This staff and I are meant to be together!" he said proudly.

Sun Wukong jumped out of the ocean with his new magical staff. He landed on the beach with a big splash. The sun was shining bright in the sky. He made the staff grow as tall as a mountain, then shrink to fit behind his ear. Only the Monkey King could lift this special weapon. It was as heavy as the sea, but felt light in his hands. Sun Wukong smiled his biggest smile. Now he was ready for any adventure!
