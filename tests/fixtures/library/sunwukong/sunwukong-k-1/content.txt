Sun Wukong is a magic monkey. He lives in a beautiful mountain. One day, he wants to play a trick. He uses his magic powers to change his face!

First, he changes into a tiger! He has big teeth and stripes. Then he becomes a bird with pretty feathers. He flies up high in the sky. His magic is so strong!

Sun Wukong laughs and changes back. He is a clever monkey again! He can change into any animal he wants. His seventy-two transformations make him the best trickster ever!
