Sun Wukong performed a respectful bow to the Dragon King and his court, promising to use the staff wisely and to remember the Dragon Palace&apos;s generosity.

He burst from the waves into the bright sunshine, somersaulting joyfully through the air toward Flower-Fruit Mountain. His monkey subjects would be so excited to see their king return with the perfect weapon, and Sun Wukong couldn&apos;t wait to show them all the amazing things his new staff could do.</p></speak>
