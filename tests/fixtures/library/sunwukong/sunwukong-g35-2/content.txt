Deep beneath the waves of the Eastern Sea, where sunlight turned the water into shimmering curtains of green and gold, there lived a powerful Dragon King in his magnificent crystal palace. Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, had recently become the leader of the monkeys on Flower-Fruit Mountain, and he was very proud of his new position. However, he had one big problem that kept him awake at night. All the weapons he had tried—swords, spears, and axes—broke easily in his incredibly strong hands because he possessed magical strength far beyond ordinary creatures. His monkey subjects whispered worries among themselves, wondering how their king could protect them without a proper weapon. One wise old monkey suggested that Sun Wukong should visit the Dragon King's treasure vault, where legendary weapons from ancient times were stored. The idea excited Sun Wukong immediately, and his eyes sparkled with mischievous delight. He performed a spectacular somersault that carried him through the clouds and down into the ocean depths. The water parted before him as if recognizing his magical power. Soon, the towering gates of the Dragon King's palace appeared before him, decorated with pearls the size of melons and coral towers that reached toward the surface. Sun Wukong landed confidently at the entrance, his golden fur barely wet despite the deep ocean surrounding him.

The Dragon King, Ao Guang, greeted Sun Wukong with elaborate courtesy, though his ancient eyes showed concern about this unexpected visitor. The throne room was breathtaking, with walls made of transparent crystal that revealed schools of colorful fish swimming past. Ao Guang wore robes that flowed like water itself, shifting between blue and green with every movement. Sun Wukong bowed respectfully but confidently explained his quest for a weapon worthy of his strength. The Dragon King stroked his long, elegant beard thoughtfully, then clapped his hands twice. Immediately, dragon warriors emerged carrying a massive golden-bladed halberd that weighed three thousand six hundred pounds. The warriors struggled under its weight, their scales glistening with effort. Sun Wukong lifted it with one hand as easily as a chopstick, twirled it playfully, and then shook his head with disappointment. The weapon felt like a toy in his powerful grip. The Dragon King's eyes widened with surprise and growing nervousness. He ordered his warriors to bring heavier and more impressive weapons from deeper in the treasure vault.

One after another, the dragon warriors presented their finest weapons to Sun Wukong, each more elaborate and heavier than the last. A massive bronze sword came next, requiring six warriors to carry it through the palace corridors. Sun Wukong tested it by swinging it in complex patterns that created whirlpools in the water around them, but he frowned and set it aside. Then came a tremendous iron trident decorated with jade and emeralds, so heavy that the floor tiles cracked when the warriors set it down. Sun Wukong performed acrobatic flips while wielding it, his movements graceful despite the weapon's enormous weight, yet he still seemed unsatisfied. The Dragon King was running out of options and beginning to worry about what this powerful monkey might do if disappointed. His advisors whispered frantically behind their fins and claws. The Dragon Queen, who had been watching from behind a pearl curtain, leaned forward and whispered something urgent into her husband's ear. Ao Guang's expression changed from worry to reluctant realization. He knew what she was suggesting, but that particular treasure was something he had hoped never to disturb again.

The Dragon King reluctantly mentioned that there was one more item, though he spoke of it with obvious hesitation in his trembling voice. Deep in the treasury, he explained, stood an iron pillar that the Great Yu had once used to measure the depths of the oceans when he was controlling the ancient floods that had devastated the land. This pillar had rested in the Dragon King's vault for thousands of years, and it possessed mysterious powers that made even the dragons nervous. It glowed with a strange golden light that never dimmed, and sometimes it hummed with energy that caused the ocean currents to swirl unpredictably. No one had been able to move it for centuries, as it seemed to have rooted itself into the very foundation of the palace. Sun Wukong's eyes lit up with intense curiosity and excitement at hearing about this legendary object. He insisted on seeing it immediately, practically bouncing with enthusiasm. The Dragon King sighed deeply, knowing he had no choice but to grant this request. He led Sun Wukong through winding corridors that descended deeper into the palace, past rooms filled with ancient treasures covered in seaweed and barnacles. The water grew darker and colder as they traveled downward into the oldest part of the vault.

When Sun Wukong finally saw the iron pillar, his heart raced with recognition that this was exactly what he had been searching for all along. The pillar stood as tall as a palace column, covered in golden bands with ancient characters that glowed mysteriously in the darkness. It was as thick as a large barrel and seemed to pulse with inner power that made the water around it shimmer and dance. Sun Wukong approached it slowly, feeling drawn to it by an invisible force he couldn't explain. The moment his fingers touched its cold surface, the pillar began to vibrate and hum with energy that resonated through his entire body. Golden light burst from the ancient characters, illuminating the entire chamber like sunrise breaking through storm clouds. The Dragon King and his warriors gasped and stepped backward in amazement and fear. Sun Wukong felt the pillar responding to him, recognizing him as its true master after all these centuries of waiting. He wrapped both hands around it firmly and spoke to it as if it were alive, asking if it would serve him faithfully. To everyone's astonishment, the pillar began to shrink, becoming smaller and smaller until it was the perfect size for Sun Wukong to wield comfortably.

The Dragon King watched in disbelief as the legendary pillar transformed into a perfect staff in Sun Wukong's capable hands. However, not all of the dragon warriors were pleased to see this sacred treasure leave their vault after guarding it for so many generations. The captain of the guard, a fierce dragon warrior named General Crab, stepped forward with his weapon drawn and his eyes blazing with protective fury. He declared that Sun Wukong was a thief trying to steal their most precious treasure, and he would not allow it to happen without a fight. Several other warriors moved to support their general, forming a defensive line with their spears pointed toward Sun Wukong. The tension in the chamber became as thick as storm clouds before lightning strikes. Sun Wukong's expression changed from joy to determination, though his mischievous grin never completely disappeared from his face. He had no intention of fighting these warriors if he could avoid it, but he also knew that this staff was meant to be his, and nothing would make him leave without it. The Dragon King held up his hand, trying to prevent violence in his palace, but General Crab refused to stand down. The other warriors began advancing slowly, their armor clanking ominously in the underwater chamber.

Sun Wukong decided to demonstrate why the staff had chosen him as its master, hoping to convince the warriors without causing harm. He whispered to the staff, and it immediately grew longer and thicker, stretching upward until it burst through the palace ceiling and rose above the ocean surface like a mighty tower. The warriors stumbled backward as water rushed through the opening and the palace shook with the staff's power. Then Sun Wukong commanded it to shrink, and it became as small as a needle, which he tucked playfully behind his ear. The warriors' eyes grew wide with wonder and respect. He made it grow and shrink several more times, spinning it with dazzling speed that created glowing circles of golden light in the water. He performed incredible acrobatic moves, leaping and flipping while the staff moved as if it were an extension of his own body. The staff responded to his every thought, changing size and weight instantly according to his wishes. General Crab slowly lowered his weapon, realizing that he was witnessing something extraordinary and destined. Even he had to admit that the staff had found its rightful owner. The other warriors followed their general's lead, bowing their heads in acknowledgment of Sun Wukong's legitimate claim to the legendary weapon.

The Dragon King, seeing that the staff had truly chosen Sun Wukong, graciously accepted the situation and even offered the Monkey King additional gifts of magical armor and cloud-walking boots. Sun Wukong thanked him with genuine respect, understanding that Ao Guang was being generous despite losing such a precious treasure from his collection. The staff, which Sun Wukong named "Ruyi Jingu Bang" meaning "As-You-Will Golden-Banded Cudgel," shrank down to a comfortable size that he could carry easily. He tucked it behind his ear where it became as small as a needle, ready to grow to any size he needed at a moment's notice. The dragon warriors, no longer hostile, actually cheered for Sun Wukong as he prepared to leave, impressed by his strength and the staff's obvious approval of him. General Crab even smiled slightly and nodded with warrior's respect toward this remarkable monkey who had proven himself worthy. Sun Wukong performed a respectful bow to the Dragon King and his court, promising to use the staff wisely and to remember the Dragon Palace's generosity. With a powerful leap, he shot upward through the ocean, the water parting before him like silk curtains. He burst from the waves into the bright sunshine, somersaulting joyfully through the air toward Flower-Fruit Mountain. His monkey subjects would be so excited to see their king return with the perfect weapon, and Sun Wukong couldn't wait to show them all the amazing things his new staff could do.
