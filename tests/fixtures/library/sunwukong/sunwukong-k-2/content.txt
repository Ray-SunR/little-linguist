Sun Wukong stood on a mountain top. He saw a beautiful cloud made of rainbows. The cloud sparkled with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple colors. Sun Wukong wanted to catch it!

Sun Wukong jumped into the sky. He used his magic cloud to fly fast. The rainbow cloud moved away quickly. Sun Wukong chased it across the bright blue sky. He laughed as he flew higher and higher!

Sun Wukong reached out his staff. He touched the rainbow cloud gently. The cloud turned into beautiful colored butterflies! They flew all around him. Sun Wukong smiled and watched them dance in the sky.
