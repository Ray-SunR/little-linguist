Long ago, on a mountain called Flower Fruit Mountain, many monkeys lived together. They played in the trees and ate sweet fruit all day long. One day, the monkeys found a beautiful waterfall. The water crashed down into a pool below. Behind the rushing water, they saw something dark and mysterious. The monkeys were very curious. They wondered what was hiding behind the waterfall.

The oldest monkey spoke up. He said whoever could jump through the waterfall would become their king. All the monkeys looked at each other nervously. The waterfall was big and powerful. The water fell fast and hard. Many monkeys were too scared to try. They stepped back from the edge. But one brave monkey was not afraid. His name was Sun Wukong, and his golden fur shined in the sunlight.

Sun Wukong smiled his mischievous smile. He took a big breath and ran toward the waterfall. His strong legs pushed off the ground. He jumped high into the air! The water rushed around him as he flew through the waterfall. For a moment, everything was wet and loud. Then suddenly, he was on the other side. Sun Wukong had made it through! He landed safely on his feet.

Behind the waterfall, Sun Wukong found something amazing. There was a big cave with stone chairs and tables. It was like a palace inside the mountain! The cave was dry and comfortable. It would be a perfect home for all the monkeys. Sun Wukong explored every corner of the wonderful cave. He knew his monkey friends would love this place. Then he took another brave jump back through the waterfall.

All the monkeys cheered when Sun Wukong came back! He told them about the beautiful cave behind the waterfall. The monkeys were so happy and excited. They all bowed to Sun Wukong. From that day on, he was their king. They called him the Handsome Monkey King. Sun Wukong led all his monkey friends through the waterfall to their new home. They lived happily together in the Water Curtain Cave on Flower Fruit Mountain.
