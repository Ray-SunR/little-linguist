Sun Wukong was a magical monkey who lived on a mountain. He was very strong and could do amazing tricks. One day, he wanted a special weapon to fight with. His monkey friends told him about the Dragon King who lived deep under the sea. The Dragon King had many treasures in his underwater palace. Sun Wukong smiled his big, brave smile. He decided to visit the Dragon King right away.

Sun Wukong jumped into the ocean with a big splash. The water opened up like a door for him. He walked down, down, down to the bottom of the sea. Pretty fish swam all around him in the blue water. Colorful coral and seaweed moved in the waves. Soon he saw a beautiful palace made of shining crystals. This was the home of the Dragon King.

The Dragon King came out to meet Sun Wukong. He had a long green body and a wise, old face. The Dragon King was a little scared of the powerful monkey. Sun Wukong asked for a weapon to use in battles. The Dragon King showed him swords and spears and axes. But Sun Wukong shook his head at each one. They were all too light and too small for him.

Then the Dragon King remembered something special. Deep in his treasure room was a magical iron pillar. It was very, very heavy and glowed with a red and gold light. This pillar could change its size however Sun Wukong wanted. The Dragon King took Sun Wukong to see it. The magical pillar stood tall in a dark room full of glowing treasures. Sun Wukong's eyes lit up with joy.

Sun Wukong grabbed the magical pillar with both hands. It felt just right! He asked it to become smaller, and it shrank to the size of a staff. He could carry it easily now. Sun Wukong thanked the Dragon King and jumped back up through the water. He returned to his mountain with his new treasure. From that day on, the magical staff became his favorite weapon. Sun Wukong was ready for any adventure!
